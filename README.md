# MSc Project - Improving Phishing Detection
Improving Phishing Techniques with Machine Learning
The aim of this project is to improve phishing detection and classfification with machine learning techniques. The study will focus on the use of textual data for model training and gain insight into how textual data is processed for the machine to perform classification.

Natural Language Processing was explored in the extraction of feature from the text content and features were tested using seven machine learning algorithms.

1. Decision Tree    
2. Logistics Regression
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Random Forest
5. K-Nearest Neighbor
6. Adaptive Boosting
7. XGBoost
